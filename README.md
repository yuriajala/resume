## Work Experience
- FIT (Fine Instrument Technology), Brazil
*Middle Analyst & Senior Applications Engineer*
JAN 2019 - JAN 2021
FIT is a bench magnetic resonance (MR) manufacturer, offering a product to control quality of products in a non-destructive manner. My roles were to develop new MR applications based on scientific literature, program pulse sequences, model and implement mathematical solutions, analyse client data, assist clients with technical support, write the product manual, and coordinate the mechanical, software and application teams to build a product from scratch.

- University Of Sao Paulo At Sao Carlos
*Teacher Assistant*
2018
Assisted Electrical Engineering & Computer Science undergratuate students in the course "Embedded Electronic Systems Programming Lab", helping them to develop Intel 8085 and Arduino applications and to produce outstanding Lab Reports using scientific method.

- Titan Aerospace, USA
*Electrical Engineer Intern*
Summer 2012
Titan Aerospace was a manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles. My roles included projecting and executing electrical schemes, ordering parts, conducting health battery tests, and testing aircraft-ground communication. [Website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Aerospace)

- BATLAB, Brazil
*Scientific Initiation Fellow*
2013 - 2014
BATLAB is a university lab for A.I. and automation. During my BSc time, I was a researcher apprentice, working on PCB design and analog filters. [Website (outdated)](https://www.facebook.com/batlab.ufms/)

## Education
- University of Sao Paulo, Brazil — *M.Sc.*
2017 - 2019
Master’s degree in medical data & image processing. By analyzing MRI images, I developed a model-based machine learning algorithm to better estimate the percentage of fat in the human liver. [Thesis (in English)](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/18/18152/tde-01102018-083519/publico/Yuri.pdf).

- UFMS, Brazil / Western Michigan University, USA — *B.Sc.*
2008 - 2014
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Awarded a scholarship to study Electrical Engineering at the Western Michigan University for one year. At that time I was part of the WMU’s [Solar Racing Car team](https://www.wmich.edu/sunseeker/) developing cooling systems.
